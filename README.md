# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: 11 February 2026**

This privacy policy applies to the **Presence** mobile application (herein referred to as "the Application"). The Application is provided as a craft tool for personal use.

### 1. Data Collection and Usage
The Application does not collect, store, or share any personal information, usage statistics, or user data. All functionality is performed locally on your device.

### 2. Permissions and Access
To provide its core functionality, the Application may request specific system permissions:

* **Access Notification Policy (Do Not Disturb):** This permission is used exclusively to silence incoming notifications during an active session to prevent interruptions. 
* **Usage:** The Application toggles this system setting only when a timer is running and restores the previous state immediately upon session completion.
* **Data Handling:** The Application does not read, record, or transmit any notification content or data associated with this permission.

### 3. Third-Party Services
The Application may utilize third-party services (such as payment processors) for patronage or support models. These services have their own privacy policies, and no personal data is shared between the Application and these providers.

### 4. Security
We value your trust in using this tool. Since no personal data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of your personal information being compromised via the Application.

### 5. Contact Us
If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, please contact:
